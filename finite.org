Notes inspired from /Constructively Finite?/ by Coquand and Spiwack

Set theory, ZFC for instance, defines a seemingly non-ambiguous notion of 
finite set. Reinforcing this feeling, any set is deemed as finite, or infinite.

This paper highlights that if any set is finite in ZFC's sense, they are not all so 
for the same reason. In particular does constructivist mathematics allow us to define
several non-equivalent notions of finiteness of sets, of which we consider four.

Their relative strengthes and closure properties are studied.

* Enumerated sets

  A set /A/ is said to be /enumerated/ when there is a list of all its elements. 
  Notation: /A/ ∈ /F/.

** Properties

*** Decidability of being inhabited

*** ∀ /A/ ∈ /F/, P ∈ (A → /Boolean/), {x | P x} ∈ F

    This fundamentally rests on P being decidable.
    It does not hold for any P ∈ (A → Prop).
    In particular, it does not hold for any f∈ B → A injective,
    i.e. /F/ is not stable under arbitrary subsets.
    
*** ∀ /A/ ∈ /F/, f ∈ A → B surjective, then /B/ ∈ /F/
  
    if /l/ is an enumeration of /A/, /f l/ is an enumeration of /B/ by virtue
    of surjectivity of /f/.
    
*** ∀ /A/, /B/ ∈ /F/, /A × B/ ∈ /F/ and /A + B/ ∈ /F/

    Binary list comprehension and appending lists respectively.

* Bounded size sets

  A set /A/ is said to have /bounded size/ if there is a natural number /N/ such that
  any list /l/ ∈ L(A) such that |l| > N has duplicates.
  Notation: /A/ ∈ /B/

  Remark: does not give a way to chose an element in /A/.

** Relation to /F/
   /F/ ⊆ /B/, the converse is false.
   
   For the inclusion, takes the size of the list associated to an enumererated
   set and conclude by the pigneon hole principle.
  
   For the converse, observe that /B/ is stable by arbitrary subset (particular
   case of next lemma). Since /F/ is not, since a non-computable injection into
   itself does not lead to /F/, we conclude.

** Properties

*** ∀ /A/ ∈ /B/, f: /B/ → /A/ injective, /B/ ∈ /B/

    By injectivity, duplicates in /f l/ entails duplicates in /l/

*** ∀ /A/ ∈ /B/, f: /A/ → /B/ surjective, /B/ ∈ /B/

    Let /N/ be A's bound and /l/ ∈ L(B) such that /N < |l|/.
    By surjectivity, ∃ /l'/ such that /l = f l'/.
    /|l'|=|l|>N/ hence |l'| has duplicates, hence the result.

*** ∀ /A/, /B/ ∈ /B/, /A × B/ ∈ /F/ and /A + B/ ∈ /B/

* Noetherian sets

  Let /A/ be a set. For any /l/ ∈ L(A), we define inductively N(l) as follows:
  * If /l/ has duplicates, then /A/ ∈ N(l)
  * If ∀ /a/ ∈ A, A ∈ N(a::l), then /A/ ∈ N(l)
  /A/ is said to be noetherian if ∀ /l/, /A/ ∈ N(l), or equivalently A∈N([])
  Notation: /A/ ∈ /N/

** Relation to /B/
   /B/ ⊆ /N/, the converse is false

* Streamless sets

  /A/ is said to be streamless if any stream of elements of /A/ admits duplicates.
  Notation: /A/ ∈ /S/

** Relation to /N/
   /N/ ⊆ /S/
   The converse is conjectured to be false.
  
** Properties 

*** ∀ /A/, /B/ ∈ /B/, /A + B/ ∈ /B/

*** Whether streamless sets are closed under cartesian product is open
